# CHAPTER_4
#Creating a Starter
Project Template

In this chapter,  Creating a starter project template involves setting up a basic structure, configurations, and files that serve as a starting point for future projects. I've learn how to create a Flutter starter project and how to structure thewidgets.  Iâ€™ll refer to this chapter, which contains the steps to create a new
starter project. Like when building a home, the foundation is the most critical factor, and the
same is true when creating new apps You created folders with the mkdir command and named them accordingly to group the logic. You
also created two Dart files: main.dart for the main() function that starts the app and home.dart to
contain the code for the Home widget.  Flutter works by nesting widgets together, and we find
out quickly that readability and maintainability takes a hit quickly.
